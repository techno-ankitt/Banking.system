# Banking.system

🏦 Ankit Digital's Bank-----
A lightweight, interactive Python-based ATM simulation system. This project demonstrates basic programming concepts like authentication, error handling, and state management with a touch of personality.

🌟 Features------
Secure Authentication: User login system with a PIN-protected interface.

Attempt Limiter: Automatically locks the account after 3 failed login attempts to prevent brute-force access.

Smart Withdrawal Logic: * Prevents withdrawal if the balance is insufficient.

Minimum withdrawal threshold (₹1,000) to encourage "meaningful" transactions.

Robust Input Validation: Uses try-except blocks to ensure the system doesn't crash if a user enters text instead of numbers.

Dynamic Balance Tracking: Real-time updates to the total amount after every successful transaction.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Core Concepts: * while loops for continuous interaction.

try-except for data validation.

Functional programming for modularity.
